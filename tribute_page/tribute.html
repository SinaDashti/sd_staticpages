                     <li><b>1914</b> - Born in Tehran, Iran</li>
                     <br>
                     <li><b>1925</b> - he was among a select few students who traveled to Europe to continue their studies.
                        There, he initially went on to study engineering in Belgium, which he abandoned after a year to study 
                        architecture in France. There he gave up architecture in turn to pursue dentistry.
                     </li>
                     <br>
                     <li><b>1927</b> - Hedayat attempted suicide by throwing himself into the Marne, 
                        but was rescued by a fishing boat.
                     </li>
                     <br>
                     <li><b>1930</b> - he finally surrendered his scholarship and returned home in the summer 
                        of 1930 without receiving a degree. 
                        In Iran he held various jobs for short periods.
                     </li>
                     <br>
                     <li>
                        Hedayat subsequently devoted his whole life to studying Western literature and to learning and 
                        investigating Iranian history and folklore. The works of Rainer Maria Rilke, Edgar Allan Poe, 
                        Franz Kafka, Anton Chekhov and Guy de Maupassant intrigued him the most. During his short literary life span, Hedayat published a substantial number of short stories and novelettes, 
                        two historical dramas, a play, a travelogue, and a collection of satirical parodies and sketches. 
                     </li>
                     <br>
                     <li><b>1931</b> - Mongol Shadow (S훮ye-ye Moqol)</li>
                     <br>
                     <li><b>1932</b> - Three Drops of Blood (Se qatre kh큰n). A collection of 11 short stories.</li>
                     <br>
                     <li><b>1932</b> - Mister Bow Wow (Vagh Vagh Sah훮b)</li>
                     <br>
                     <li><b>1936</b> - The Blind Owl (Boof-e koor)</li>
                     <br>
                     <li><b>1951</b> - Overwhelmed by despair, Hedayat left Tehr훮n and traveled to Paris, where he rented an apartment. A few days before his death, Hedayat tore up all of his unpublished work. On April 9, 1951, he plugged all the doors and windows of his rented apartment with cotton, then turned on the gas valve, committing suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning. Two days later, his body was found by police, 
                        with a note left behind for his friends and companions that read, 
                        <b>"I left and broke your heart"</b>. That is all.
                     </li>
                     <br>
                     <p id="last">In November 2006, republication of Hedayat's work in uncensored form was banned in Iran, as part of a sweeping purge. However, 
                        surveillance of book-stalls is limited and it is apparently still possible to purchase the originals second-hand.
